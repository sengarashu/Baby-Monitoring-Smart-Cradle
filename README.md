Baby Monitoring Smart Cradle

Project Title: Baby Monitoring Smart Cradle 

Introduction: 
As we are very well familiar with the hurdles faced by Parents to nurture their infant and especially in case if both the Parents are working. To give 24 hours of time in such cases is next to impossible. Thus, we need to develop something unique that can help Parents to have a continuous surveillance/watch on the Baby/Infant and can notify about the same. 
Thus, we have come up with an idea to design a Smart Cradle System using IOT which will help the Parents to monitor their child even if they are away from home & detect every activity of the Baby from any distant corner of the world. 
BABY MONITORING SMART CRADLE – How it is a boon for Parents? 
It is an innovative, smart & protective Cradle System to nurtue an infant in an efficient way. This system considers all the minute details required for the care & protection of the Baby in the cradle. The design of smartness & innovation comes with the use of technologies/methodologies which include Internet Of Things (IOT) (Modules like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Humidity & Temperature sensing), Swing Automation, Cry Detecting Mechanism, Live Video Surveillance, Cloud Computing (Data Storage) & User Friendly Android Mobile Application (for User Controls). 
In order to detect each & every activity of Baby, different Sensors/Modules are attached to the Cradle: Humidity & Temperature Sensing Module for detection of Wetness of the bed, A Camera on top of the Cradle for live video footage & Cry Detection Circuit to analyse Cry Patterns which eventually triggers the swinging mechanism (if required based on the range of frequency). 
All the data which is been taken from the sensors/modules will be stored in Cloud (Google Firebase) & analyzed at regular intervals. A Health Algorithm is applied to these datasets to get information about the body conditions which is helpful as any regular symptoms of a disease can be identified easily. 
An instant mobile notification will be generated if any abnormal activity is detected (something unusual OR crying of baby OR wetness due to Baby Urine) in the Android Mobile Application which has been developed. It has UI controls which include the feature of controlling the swinging mechanism of the cradle (can be turned on, turned off & can maintain the speed of swing), control for switching on the camera live footage & controls for playing the toy/projector whenever the baby cries.
